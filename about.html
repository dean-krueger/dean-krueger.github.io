            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2020 
                with a B.A. in Physics. While there, I worked in the Begelman 
                high energy computational astrophysics group under the guidance 
                of Dr. Bhupendra Mishra, modeling the effect of magnetic field 
                orientation on black hole accretion disk transport. This work 
                challenged my programming skills, introduced me to 
                high-performance computing, and formed the foundation of my 
                experience with computational physics, inspiring a deep interest 
                in both computational modeling and astrophysics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduation, I began work as an Applications Engineer at 
                Vescent Photonics, a company that specialized in the design and
                manufacture of lasers and optoelectronics for use in cold atom 
                experiments, quantum computers, and fiber frequency combs. At 
                Vescent, I developed key skills in electronics, instrumentation,
                and technical writing and communication. The role provided my  
                first exposure to engineering practice and precision laboratory 
                systems, and I stayed with the company for two years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2023, I began my graduate studies as a master's student at 
                the University of Wisconsin-Madison and worked under Dr. Ben 
                Lindley to develop modeling tools for studying the fusion fuel 
                cycle. This work led to the development of Tricycle, a 
                low-fidelity but flexible module for the fuel cycle simulation 
                code Cyclus and was designed to explore fusion deployment 
                scenarios and assess global tritium availability under varying 
                demand. A preliminary version of this work was presented at the 
                2024 TOFE Conference in Madison, Wisconsin, and a more complete 
                paper will be published soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2024, I accepted an internship at Westinghouse 
                Electric Company and joined the core design team. There, I 
                worked on the design of PWR core loading patterns that were 
                capable of accommodating cycle length extensions using 
                Westinghouse’s Integral Fuel Burnable Absorber (IFBA). The work 
                focused heavily on reactor physics, core design, and safety 
                analysis concepts, and was an invaluable experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                After returning to the University of Wisconsin in the fall of 
                2024, I accepted a position as a Ph.D. student working in the 
                Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) under 
                Dr. Paul Wilson. My current research focuses on enhancing the 
                front-end realism of Cyclus through the addition of economic 
                and financial modeling and long-term contracts. My hope is to 
                use the tools I develop to provide insight into current events 
                and policy related to the nuclear fuel cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Across these experiences, I've become especially interested in 
                how computational modeling can bridge the gap between technical 
                innovation and policy implementation. My long-term goal is to 
                advance open, reproducible tools that make complex energy 
                decisions more transparent and data-driven.
